It can be very jarring when somebody is called out of the blue and they are not expecting it. They might be deep in a task or talking to a client and by calling them their focus gets disrupted. Even better, **mention the reason** before calling.

If it’s not urgent, before calling, ping someone on IM first with *"Can I call you now? It's about xxx"*

If it is urgent or you are blocked, then proceed with a warning *“Calling you in 1 min to talk about xxx.”*

The gold standard is to provide a source so the person being called has a reference explaining the reason for the call in detail.

## Start a call warm, not cold

If your conversation requires a discussion, then it's time to initiate a call. If the conversation has history, like a PBI or email, then it's important to include that context. That way the other person can prioritise your call. 

For example, if you mention that you want to talk about an email from several years ago they might think it isn't that important.

Conversely, if you mention the production server is down, they will almost definitely answer you!

Other reasons for this:

* It is important to go the extra mile when you are asking someone else for something… so be as considerate as possible
* It puts you into their chat history, so even if they decline the call, they can easily write back to you to explain why
* Giving someone even a 1 minute warning is a good idea even if you see their Teams Status is on green ‘available’. Remember it is not easy to always change their status to ‘busy’ - they could be on a mobile phone, on a WhatsApp call, in a physical meeting, etc.

Also, everyone likes breathing space, so try to give about a minute's warning for any call.

**Tip:** For the example above, PBIs often have long URLs. Break a line for better readability.

### Using the Share to Teams option via Outlook

### What if your call is declined?

When a call is declined, it is important to follow up in order to ensure the task remains a priority and does not get forgotten.

:::greybox
"Tried to call - will try again in 1 hour"
:::
:::good
Good example - Send them a message indicating you will try again later

**Tip:** The [follow-up effectively](/follow-up-effectively) rule will help you remember to call.
